# Default-pytorch

This code is a copy from:

https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist

The code was classified simply to make it easier to use.

A model layer can be implemented within a Net class. By default, each Optimizer is set to Adadelta and the Scheduler is set to StepLR, but it can be changed depending on the purpose. You can also add command line arguments.
